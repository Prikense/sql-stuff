-Constraints in SQL
    -Primary Keys
        -Primary keys are unique identifiers for a database, as such they should
         be unique and not null.
    -Foreing Keys
        -Foreign keys are used to relate data between 2 or more databases,
         usually making a column on a table be the primary key of another.
    -Constraints
        -In sql we can use constraints to specify the data type of a column,
         we can use CHECK and CHECK IN to control the data that comes in,
         and also to validate the data.
